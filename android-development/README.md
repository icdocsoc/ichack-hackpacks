# Android Development with Kotlin

In this guide, we will cover the basics of Android development, using **Kotlin**, Google's preferred language for Android mobile development since 2019, and **Jetpack Compose**, Android's modern UI toolkit.

We will assume a basic working knowledge of Kotlin, and general object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, but if you need some further guidance on this, don't worry! The [official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) is a very useful tool.

To follow along, you'll probably also want to download **Android Studio**, the official IDE for Android app development. Use the [detailed installation instructions](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio) for Windows, macOS, and Linux on the Android Developers website.
