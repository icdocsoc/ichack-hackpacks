# Prompt Engineering

In this guide you will find useful information about setting up APIs for different LLMs and also how to prompt them effectively.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is a new and emerging art of crafting instructions to get LLMs like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and others, to produce the output you want. 

The key ideas are:
 - **Be Specific** - This includes the language, format and any constraints
 - **Be Explicit About Context** - Provide relevant code snippets, error messages and requirements
 - **Iterate Interactively** - Refine your prompt based on the outputs
 - **Set The Role** - "You are a coding assistant...", "Act as a debugging tool..."
