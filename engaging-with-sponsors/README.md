# Engaging with Sponsors

*This HackPack is heavily adapted from [DurHack's 'Hacking Your Future' HackPack](https://medium.com/@DurHack_press/hacking-your-future-how-to-best-engage-with-sponsors-in-a-hackathon-47423f3959e9). Thank you to Adrienne Lam and the DurHack team for this resource.*

In this HackPack, we'll take a brief look at how to maximise your time at IC Hack, not just by developing an interesting project, but also by taking advantage of the extensive in-person sponsor presence.

IC Hack is **the largest student-run hackathon in Europe**, and that's only possible thanks to the support of [our sponsors](https://ichack.org/#sponsors). This year, we're proud to welcome `{final number of sponsors}` to IC Hack, with `{final number of gold/silver sponsors}` attending in-person, across a variety of different sectors (tech, finance, AI and more!).

But, *why do our sponsors actually attend*? Well, they want access to **you**: they're scouting for talent to hire in the future by promoting themselves through sponsor booths, talks and categories. So, how can you make the most of that interest?

## Before IC Hack

Engaging effectively starts long before the 31st January!

- Take a look at the [sponsors section of the IC Hack website](https://ichack.org/#sponsors) before the actual hackathon begins. **Review every company sponsoring**, from our title sponsor, [Marshall Wace](https://www.mwam.com/), to all the gold, silver, and bronze sponsors. Don’t just look at the logo; click through to their careers page and their “*About Us*” too!
- Identify the **industry** they operate in and their **tech stack**. Which companies use the programming language or framework you love? Which ones are tackling a problem you're passionate about?
- Formulate your **connection with companies**. Prepare a concise, one-sentence reason why you're interested in their specific company, such as:
  - “I love how your company’s *xxx* is able to do *xxx*,”
  - “Your commitment to *xxx* really resonated with me!”.

## Attending sponsor talks

The sponsor talks throughout the weekend are designed for you to engage as effectively as possible with our title and gold sponsors, so don't miss them!

- **Go to the source.** Workshops are not just free lessons. Attend workshops hosted by companies you are genuinely interested in, as this shows commitment and initiative.
- **Ask smart questions.** Don't ask a question you could easily Google. Ask questions that show you have thought deeply about their technology or challenge.
  - For example, instead of *"What programming languages do you use?"* ask, *"I noticed your team uses Rust for your low-latency systems. What challenges did you face migrating from C++, and how do you onboard new developers?"*.
- **Stick around.** After the main presentation, politely approach the presenter. Thank them, introduce yourself, and maybe briefly mention how you might [integrate their tech into your hackathon project](#making-the-most-of-challenges)!

## Sponsor booths

The physical booth is another great opportunity to market yourself as a potential candidate, rather than just a hackathon attendee, so make sure to visit them!

- **Keep it brief.** Representatives have many people to talk to. Have an "elevator pitch" ready in your head so they can easily remember you: your name, your year/course, one impressive project (or your current hackathon idea), and why you’re interested in their company. For example:
  > "Hi, I'm Alex, a second-year Computing student at Imperial. I recently built a real-time collaborative code editor using WebSockets, and I'm really excited about your distributed systems work. I'd love to learn more about internship opportunities!"
- **Ask targeted questions.** Use your research from [before](#before-ic-hack).
  - For *internship insights*: “What is the most common project an intern on your engineering team would work on?”
  - For *company culture*: “What is a major development challenge your team is currently tackling, and how does your company philosophy guide that solution?”
- **Exchange contacts.** If the conversation goes well, politely ask for a recruiter email or if you can connect on LinkedIn. Don't just connect with a booth representative, though — ask first (e.g. “Would it be alright if I connected with you on LinkedIn to follow up on this conversation?”).

## Making the most of challenges

At IC Hack 26, you'll have the opportunity to participate in one of our `{number of regular challenges}` challenges, and our `{number of BUO challenges}` 'Best use of' challenges. These can be a great way to impress the respective sponsors associated with each!

### Regular sponsor tracks

All gold sponsors will be present **in-person** at their booths throughout the hackathon, so take advantage of this direct access!

- **Listen carefully at the opening ceremony.** Each sponsor will introduce their track and explain what they're looking for. Pay close attention to fully understand the intention and meaning behind their challenge. This will help you tailor your project to what they actually want to see.
- **Visit their booth.** Don't be shy about approaching the sponsor booth to discuss your ideas. They *want* to help you succeed in their track, so ask clarifying questions about the challenge requirements or scope.
- **Use Discord.** Each sponsor has a dedicated Discord channel where you can ask questions and get guidance. This is especially useful if the booth is busy or unstaffed at particular times.
- **Ask for feedback.** As your project develops, feel free to check in with the sponsor for feedback on whether you're heading in the right direction. Just be mindful not to overdo it. A couple of check-ins over the weekend is reasonable, but don't bombard them with constant updates!

### 'Best use of' challenges

These challenges reward creative and effective use of specific tools or technologies. Unlike regular tracks, the sponsors for these challenges may not be present in-person, so your approach will be slightly different.

- **Read the HackPack.** Each 'Best use of' challenge has an associated HackPack with guidance, tutorials, and tips. Make sure to read through it thoroughly before diving in.
- **Explore the documentation.** Go beyond the basics. Read through the official online documentation, tutorials, and examples to understand the full range of features available to you. The more you can leverage the tool's capabilities, the more impressive your project will be.
- **Get creative.** Think about how you can maximise the features available. What unique or innovative ways can you integrate the technology into your project?
- **Ask for help on Discord.** Since these sponsors might not be at the venue, their Discord channel is your primary point of contact. Don't hesitate to ask questions as they're there to help!

## Presenting to sponsors

When it comes to judging, you may present directly to sponsor representatives. This is your last, and possibly best, chance to impress a sponsor's representatives, so tailor your presentation if you can!

- **Acknowledge their contribution.** If you used a company’s tech, explicitly thank the sponsor and call out how their tool made your project better or possible.
- **Focus on the motivation.** If your solution aligns with a social or technical challenge the sponsor is known for (e.g. scalability, data security), emphasise that alignment.

Treat every interaction with a sponsor as a professional conversation. Be prepared, be polite, and most importantly, be genuine. The connections you make during that weekend could easily lead to your first great internship!

Good luck, and happy hacking!
