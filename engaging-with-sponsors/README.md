# Engaging with Sponsors

In this HackPack, we'll take a brief look at how to maximise your time at IC Hack, not just by developing an interesting project, but also by taking advantage of the extensive in-person sponsor presence.

IC Hack is **the largest student-run hackathon in Europe**, and that's only possible thanks to the support of [our sponsors](https://ichack.org/#sponsors). This year, we're proud to welcome `{final number of sponsors}` to IC Hack, with `{final number of gold/silver sponsors}` attending in-person, across a variety of different sectors (tech, finance, AI and more!).

But, *why do our sponsors actually attend*? Well, they want access to **you**: they're scouting for talent to hire in the future by promoting themselves through sponsor booths, talks and categories. So, how can you make the most of that interest?
