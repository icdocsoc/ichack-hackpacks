# Project Planning

In this guide, you will find information on how to form a team and manage your time at IC Hack successfully.

## How to form a team

Each team can have up to **6 members**. We strongly suggest finding a team well before IC Hack. Couldn't find a team or don't know where to do so? We have a team-building channel in **Discord** that you can use!

### `#looking-for-team`

1. Open the `#looking-for-team` channel.
2. Browse the existing threads in the channel and contact the users involved if you are interested in joining their team.
3. If there isn’t a suitable team you want to join, open up a new thread. Remember to include:
    - Who is in your team?
    - What skills do you have?
    - What kind of teammates are you looking for?
    - And, most importantly, how can you be contacted? (This can just be your Discord account as long as your DMs are open.)
4. Once you have formed a team via `#looking-for-team`, please delete your thread from the channel

## Tips to form an effective team

When forming a team for a hackathon, there are always some things to consider:

### What kind of product do you want to build?

Before forming a team, think about the end product. It could be anything along these lines:

- Web apps,
- Mobile apps,
- AI tools,
- Hardwares etc.

After having an initial idea of the product, then identify the skills required to build it.

### Common Skills

A well-rounded team often includes a mix of people with the following skills:

- **AI / Machine Learning**: model building, data processing, intelligent features.
- **Frontend Development**: user-facing interfaces (React, Vue, mobile frameworks).
- **Backend Development**: APIs, authentication, business logic.
- **Databases / Infrastructure**: data modelling, storage, deployment
- **UI/UX Design**: user flows, visual design, branding. (Figma)

Always remember not every team needs all of these roles filled, but you should still seek the skills most needed for your project! Also, if you've already formed a team and are missing some of these skills, don't worry! That's what the other HackPacks are for.

> **Top Tip:**
> It is important to have someone in your group who understands **UI/UX design and frontend development** as this is how judges *see* your idea working, not just hear about it. A good UI also makes demos smoother and pitch preparation much easier.

## Work allocation

While working flexibly between different components of your project is important, consider allocating work across these areas. As you'll see, they're quite similar to the 'skill areas' that we identified before.

- **Frontend engineers** are responsible for implementing the UI design of an application.
- **Backend engineers** manage the APIs, databases, and logic associated with an application.
- **AI/ML engineers** may be required, depending on the scope of the project.
- **Designers** handle UI/UX design, visuals, and graphics for your final pitch such as slides and animations.
- **Product/presentation leads** focus on developing your documentation, demo, and final pitch.

> **Top Tip:**  
> Assign at least two team members to focus on the **presentation, demo, and DevPost documentation/submission** in the last few hours of hacking. It can be easy to get wrapped up in your project after that much time spent coding, but planning ahead to ensure you're able to clearly explain your project and present well can make a massive difference.

## Time management

Effective time management is crucial to success at IC Hack. Making good use of the limited hacking time will help your team stay focused, avoid last-minute stress, and deliver a polished project.

**Hacking Period:**

- 🕛 **Start:** Saturday 31st Jan, 12:00 PM  
- 🕛 **Deadline:** Sunday 1st Feb, 12:00 PM

You can expect to spend around **1–2 hours before hacking starts** to attend the opening ceremony, potentially form your team, and do some initial planning.

## Suggested Hackathon Timeline

> **Disclaimer:**
> Don't feel obligated to follow this too closely! It's just a suggestion to hopefully streamline your hacking process a bit more.
