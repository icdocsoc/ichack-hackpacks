In this guide you will find information about effective team forming and time management suggestions.

# 1. How to form a team early????

Each team can have up to **6 members**. We strongly suggest you to find a team early before ICHACK. Couldn't find a team / don't know where to find a team? We have a team-building channel in Discord that you can use!

## Discord: #looking-for-team
1. Join `#looking-for-team` channel
2. Browse the threads in the channel and contact them if you are interested in joining their team
3. If there isn’t a suitable team you want to join, open up a new thread. Remember to include:
    - Who is in your team
    - What skills do you have
    - What kind of teammates are you looking for
    - And most importantly, your contact details (or just your Discord account as long as your dms are open)
4. Once you have formed a team via looking-for-team, please delete your thread from the channel

# 2. Tips on forming an effective team

When forming a group for hackathon, there are always something to consider:

## What kind of product are you wanting to build? 

Before forming a team, think about the end product. It can be anything like
- Web apps
- Mobile apps
- AI tools
- Platforms etc.

After having an initial idea of the product, then idenify the skills required to build it

## Common Skills

A well-rounded team often includes a mix of:
- **AI / Machine Learning**
    model building, data processing, intelligent features
- **Frontend Devlopment**
    user-facing interfaces (React, Vue, mobile frameworks)
- **Backend / Full Stack Development**
    APIs, authentication, business logic
- **Database / Infrastructure**
    data modelling, storage, deployment
- **UI/UX /  Graphic Design**
    user flows, visual design, branding

>Always remember not every team need all roles, but instead find the skills most needed for your project!


# 3. Work allocation 

While flexibility is important, consider allocate work in these area:

- **Frontend**
responsible for UI implementation
- **Backend** 
manages APIs, databases, and logic
- **AI/ML Engineer** (if applicable)
- **Designer** 
UI/UX, visuals, pitch slides
- **Product / Presentation** 
focuses on documentation, demo, and final pitch

> **Top Tip**  
> Assign at least one team member to focus on the **presentation, demo, and write-up** later in the hackathon. After long hours of coding, teams are often too exhausted to clearly explain their project or record a strong presentation, and planning ahead makes a huge difference.
