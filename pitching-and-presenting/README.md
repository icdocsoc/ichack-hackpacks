# Pitching and Presenting

After 24 hours of intense hacking, you have your end-product. It's not over yet though - it still comes down to how well you present your project to the judges in a very limited span of time.

In this guide, we will provide you with some tips and tricks on how to manage the pitching and presenting part at IC Hack successfully!

## Structure
You will have (approximately) **3 minutes** to pitch your project to the judges, followed by a quick Q&A session. If you have entered multiple categories, you will have to pitch multiple times.

We would advise you to cover the following in your pitches (not necessarily in the order below):
- *Problem* - what problem are you trying to solve?
- *Technical solution* - what have you built to solve this problem?
- *Demo* - demonstrate to the judges how your product is working (ideally live demo)!
- *Linkage to your chosen category* - how has your product managed to link to the theme of each category?
- and anything else that you think is worth mentioning!
