# Pitching and Presenting

After 24 hours of intense hacking, you (hopefully) have your end product. It's not over yet though - it still comes down to how well you present your project to the judges in a very limited span of time.

In this guide, we will provide you with some tips and tricks on how to manage the pitching and presenting part at IC Hack successfully!

## Structure

You will have (approximately) **3 minutes** to pitch your project to the judges, followed by a quick Q&A session.

If you have entered multiple categories, you will have to pitch multiple times (you may want to adjust your pitch based on the category, and you could improve based on feedback on your first one!).

We would advise you to cover the following in your pitches (not necessarily in the order below):

- *Team introductions* - keep this brief, but it's still a good idea for judges to know who you are! A quick round of names and what you each worked on is plenty.
- *Problem* - what problem are you trying to solve? A compelling opening line or hook relating to your problem could make a big difference too.
- *Technical solution* - what have you built to solve this problem?
- *Demo* - demonstrate to the judges how your product is working (ideally live demo)!
- *Linking to the category* - how does your product fit in with the category that you're currently presenting on?
- and anything else that you think is worth mentioning!

## Preparing for the pitch

As we have mentioned in our [project planning HackPack](../project-planning/), you should be working on preparing your pitch and demo in the last few hours of hacking.

### Slides

Slides are not absolutely necessary to successfully present your project, but it could be great to have visual aids to help you during your presentation! You might find the following tips helpful:

- Keep text minimal; people read slower than you speak.
- Use visuals and graphics: diagrams, numbers, screenshots, and not long paragraphs of text!
- High contrast, legible fonts, consistent layout: looks more organised.
- Cue cards (or notes): they should be for *cues* and you shouldn't need to refer to them too often. Focus on the people that you are presenting to!

### Demo

This is where your product actually comes to life in front of the judges - make the best use of this opportunity!

- Choose the (1-2) most valuable user flows to demo. You won't have time to demonstrate every user journey in your product!
- Keep states simple: set up demo accounts/data and pre-run steps in advance.
- Rehearse transitions between slides and demo (especially if you have multiple presenters).
- Definitely test your demo beforehand to try and minimise any surprises!
- Prepare a fallback solution in case the live demo fails! This could be a pre-recorded video or series of screenshots.

### Delivery

How you deliver your pitch makes a lasting impact and impression on the judges; here are a few pieces of advice to help you out:

- **Speak clearly** - ideally slightly slower than your normal conversation speed.
- Use **short sentences and pauses** so key points stand out.
- **Eye contact** - make sure you are looking at the audience and not just on your laptop/cue cards all the time!
- **Body language** - a suitable amount of body gestures to emphasise key ideas is great (just don't overdo it)!
- **Energy** - be passionate about your project!

## Handling nerves

It's completely normal to feel nervous before presenting, especially if it's your first hackathon! Here are a few ways to manage those nerves:

- **Breathe** - take a few slow, deep breaths before you start. It helps calm your nerves and steadies your voice.
- **Remember: judges want you to succeed** - they're not there to catch you out; they genuinely want to see cool projects and are rooting for you!
- **Focus on your project, not yourself** - shift your mindset from "everyone is watching me" to "I get to show off something I built." You know your project better than anyone in the room.
- **It's okay to make mistakes** - if you stumble over a word or forget something, just pause, take a breath, and carry on. The judges won't mind.
- **Practice with your team** - running through your pitch a few times beforehand makes it feel more familiar and less daunting.
- **Arrive early** - give yourself time to set up and get comfortable with the space before your slot.

### Other tips and tricks

- Try to avoid complicated jargon; having a few technical terms is fine but what technologies/frameworks that you used isn't always the main point of the presentation!
- During Q&A, listen fully to the question first before answering (it's rude to cut off your judges).
- If you don't know the answer to a question, treat it as an opportunity to bring your project further! Phrase it as a chance for further development, rather than trying to hide a deficiency or shortcoming.
- **Time management** - keep a close eye on the timer; the last thing you want is to have an abrupt ending to your pitch! Rehearse your timings well in advance.

> **Final Tip**: Practice, practice and practice! More practice perfects your pitch and puts you in a great position for the actual thing :) Good luck!
